/*
 * Allocates and initializes a prefab class, and the following fields:
 *  - Short description
 *  - Long description
 *  - Stats
 * To add skill-related fields, see class_prefab_add_skills().
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  - game: The current game struct (contains the global stat hashtable, which 
 *         can be NULL).
 *  - class_name: The name of the prefab class to be generated.  Must match one
 *                of our classes.
 * 
 * Note: class_name is case insensitive, but the name stored is always lowercase.
 * 
 * Returns:
 *  - A pointer to the new class on success, NULL on failure.

 *
 * Returns:
 *  - status code (FAILURE if the given class or skill is NULL, SUCCESS otherwise.)
 *  - the structs in the class now contain skills.
 * 
 * Notes:
 *  - This function is not fully implemented, as we are waiting for the skill
 *    effects to be more fully developed. However, the warrior class does work,
