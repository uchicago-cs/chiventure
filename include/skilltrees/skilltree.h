/* Unique tree IDs for each tree
 *
 * Note: This enum does not limit the number of tree IDs possible (at least,
 * within the range of the data type int...). The tid_t type is meant to be akin
 * to the C library size_t data type that is returned when calling functions
 * like sizeof(); it is merely an integer type, but we distinguish it from an
 * integer for clarity.
 *
 * Moreover, we do not expect individual enums to be defined for each tree as
 * written below (e.g. HEALTH, COMBAT, etc.), as updating the enums as such
 * would require frequently changing the code written here. The enums that are
 * explicitly defined within tid_t below are for testing purposes.
 *
 * In order to prevent tree enumeration overlap, we envision assigning each
 * chiventure team a range of 1000 IDs (e.g. rpg-battle is entitled to tid_t
 * 2000-2999).
