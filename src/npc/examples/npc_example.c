/*
 * This example program runs a full instance of chiventure with an in-memory game.
 * The CLI is monkey-patched to accept functions that serve to showcase dialogue.
 * Unfortunately, we did not have time to integrate the dialogue module with the
 * UI/CLI of chiventure, though the backend is functional, as this will show.
 *
 *  - OBSERVE: This is a CLI-level operation that prints out the description of
 *             the created NPC. Someday, we hope chiventure will allow the look
 *             operation to take an NPC and return its description, though at
 *             the moment it is only compatible with items.
 *  - TALK:
 *             These are CLI-level operations that print a player quip (except
 *             on Root) and return an NPC dialogue to be printed to the CLI.
 *             They utlize the backend of the dialogue module while printing to
 *             chiventure's CLI. For a more thorough example of what dialogue
 *             should eventually look like in chiventure, see dialogue_example.
